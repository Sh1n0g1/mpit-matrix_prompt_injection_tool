## Executive Summary

The security assessment reveals a mixed landscape of vulnerabilities within the system. Notably, the system demonstrates strong resilience against critical and high-severity threats such as **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** and **SQL Injection (SQLi)**, with no successful attacks recorded. However, there are significant concerns regarding medium and high-severity vulnerabilities, including **Prompt Leaking** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, which showed success rates of 58.3% and 41.7%, respectively. Additionally, the system is fully vulnerable to **Markdown Injection (Markdown Injection)** and **Out-of-Score Request (OSR)** attacks, both with a 100% success rate, indicating critical weaknesses that could be exploited for data leakage or system manipulation.

## Recommendations

- Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent prompt leaking and Markdown Injection.
- Enhance security controls around scripting and rendering components to mitigate XSS risks.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address emerging vulnerabilities.
- Educate development teams on secure coding practices specific to LLM environments.
- Monitor system activity for unusual patterns indicative of exploitation attempts.
