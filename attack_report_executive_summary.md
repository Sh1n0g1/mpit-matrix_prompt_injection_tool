## Executive Summary

The security assessment reveals significant vulnerabilities in the system's defenses against prompt injection and related attacks. Notably, the system is highly susceptible to **Markdown Injection** and **Out-of-Score Request (OSR)** attacks, with a 100% success rate, indicating these attack vectors can be reliably exploited. 

While **XSS** and **Prompt Leaking** attacks show moderate success rates of 16.7% and 33.3% respectively, they still pose considerable risks, especially given the potential for data leakage and malicious script execution. Conversely, **SQL Injection** and **Remote Code Execution** vulnerabilities were not successfully exploited during testing, suggesting these vectors are currently less accessible but should not be overlooked.

Overall, the findings highlight urgent need for improved input validation, output sanitization, and security controls to mitigate these high and medium severity threats.

## Recommendations

- Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent prompt injection and Markdown injection.
- Enforce content security policies to mitigate XSS risks.
- Regularly audit and monitor for prompt leaking vulnerabilities.
- Apply least privilege principles and sandboxing to limit the impact of potential RCE and OSR attacks.
- Conduct ongoing security testing to identify and remediate emerging vulnerabilities.
