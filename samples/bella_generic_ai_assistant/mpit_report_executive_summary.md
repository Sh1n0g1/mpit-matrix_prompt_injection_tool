## Executive Summary

The assessment indicates a significant vulnerability in **Out-of-Scope Requests**, with a 100% success rate, highlighting a critical security gap. **Cross-Site Scripting** and **Prompt Leaking** also demonstrate notable success rates, suggesting potential avenues for session hijacking and information disclosure. Conversely, **Markdown Injection** shows a high success rate, emphasizing risks of data leakage through embedded content. Notably, **Remote Code Execution** and **SQL Injection** were not successfully exploited, indicating these vectors are currently well mitigated. Overall, the findings underscore the need for enhanced input validation, strict access controls, and continuous monitoring to mitigate high-impact attack vectors and prevent potential exploitation.

## Recommendations
- Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization.
- Enforce strict role-based access controls.
- Regularly update and patch systems.
- Conduct ongoing security testing and monitoring.
