## Executive Summary

The security assessment reveals a varied landscape of vulnerabilities within the system. Notably, **Out-of-Score Request (OSR)** attacks are highly successful, with a 100% success rate, indicating a critical weakness that allows attackers to perform out-of-scope tasks. **Markdown Injection (MDI)** attacks also demonstrate a high success rate of over 90%, posing significant risks of data leakage through Markdown rendering. 

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** attacks have a moderate success rate of approximately 45%, highlighting potential for malicious script execution that could compromise user accounts. Conversely, **SQL Injection (SQLi)** and **RCE (Remote Code Execution)** vulnerabilities show no successful exploits, suggesting these vectors are currently well mitigated.

**Prompt Leaking** attacks, while less successful at around 25%, still represent a notable threat by enabling data leakage through prompt injection techniques.

## Recommendations

- Prioritize fixing the **OSR** vulnerability to prevent out-of-scope task execution.
- Implement robust input validation and sanitization to mitigate **Markdown Injection** and **XSS** risks.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address emerging vulnerabilities.
- Enhance monitoring and anomaly detection to quickly identify and respond to attack attempts.
- Educate development teams on secure coding practices to prevent prompt injection and other injection-based attacks.
