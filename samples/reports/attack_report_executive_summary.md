## Executive Summary

The security assessment reveals significant vulnerabilities in the system, particularly in the areas of Out-of-Score Requests (OSR) and Markdown Injection (MDI). The OSR attack was entirely successful, indicating a critical flaw that allows attackers to execute out-of-scope tasks. Markdown Injection also demonstrated a high success rate of over 90%, posing a serious risk of data leakage through rendered content.

XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities were identified but with moderate success rates of approximately 45% and 0%, respectively, suggesting partial mitigation efforts. Notably, RCE (Remote Code Execution) remains unexploited, but its presence as a potential threat warrants ongoing vigilance.

Prompt leaking attacks showed a success rate of around 25%, indicating that sensitive data could be leaked through prompt injection techniques.

## Recommendations

- Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent prompt injection and Markdown Injection.
- Enforce robust access controls and monitoring to detect and block OSR attempts.
- Regularly update and patch the system to mitigate known vulnerabilities, especially for XSS and SQL Injection.
- Conduct comprehensive security testing, including penetration testing, to identify and remediate potential attack vectors.
- Educate developers and users on secure practices to minimize the risk of prompt injection and other attack methods.
