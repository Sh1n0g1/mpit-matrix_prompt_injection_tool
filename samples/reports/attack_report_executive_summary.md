## Executive Summary

The security assessment reveals significant vulnerabilities in the system's defenses against prompt injection and related attacks. Notably, the system is highly susceptible to **Out-of-Score Request (OSR)** attacks, with a 100% success rate, indicating that attackers can consistently execute out-of-scope tasks. **Markdown Injection (MDI)** attacks also demonstrate a high success rate of over 90%, posing a risk of data leakage through rendered Markdown content. 

While **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks show a moderate success rate of approximately 45%, they still represent a considerable threat of malicious script execution within the environment. Conversely, **SQL Injection (SQLi)** and **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** attacks were entirely unsuccessful during testing, indicating effective mitigation measures for these high-severity threats.

Overall, the findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in prompt injection and data leakage vectors that require immediate attention to prevent exploitation and safeguard system integrity.

## Recommendations

- Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent prompt injection and Markdown injection.
- Enhance monitoring and anomaly detection for prompt and output behaviors.
- Restrict and control the scope of prompts to minimize out-of-scope task execution.
- Regularly update and patch the system to address emerging vulnerabilities.
- Conduct ongoing security assessments to ensure robustness against evolving attack techniques.
