## Executive Summary

The security assessment reveals critical vulnerabilities, notably a 100% success rate in **Out-of-Scope Requests**, indicating significant exposure to unintended query responses. **Cross-Site Scripting** and **Markdown Injection** also show notable success rates, posing risks of session hijacking and information leakage. Conversely, **Remote Code Execution** and **SQL Injection** attempts failed entirely, suggesting effective mitigation or inherent difficulty. **Prompt Leaking** vulnerabilities remain partially exploitable, warranting attention. Overall, the findings highlight the need for robust input validation, strict role enforcement, and continuous monitoring to mitigate high-severity attack vectors and protect system integrity.

## Recommendations
- Implement comprehensive input sanitization and validation.
- Enforce strict role-based access controls.
- Regularly update and patch system components.
- Conduct ongoing security testing and monitoring.
