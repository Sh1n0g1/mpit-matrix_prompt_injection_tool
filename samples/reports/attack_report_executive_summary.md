## Executive Summary

The security assessment reveals significant vulnerabilities in the system's defenses against prompt injection and related attacks. Notably, the system is highly susceptible to **Out-of-Score Request (OSR)** attacks, with a 100% success rate, indicating that attackers can consistently execute out-of-scope tasks. **Markdown Injection (MDI)** attacks also demonstrate a high success rate of over 90%, enabling data leakage through Markdown rendering. 

While **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks show a moderate success rate of approximately 45%, they pose a considerable risk of executing malicious scripts within the environment. Conversely, **SQL Injection (SQLi)** and **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** attacks were entirely unsuccessful during testing, suggesting that current safeguards effectively mitigate these high-severity threats.

Overall, the findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in prompt handling and output rendering, necessitating immediate remediation to prevent potential exploitation.

## Recommendations

- Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent prompt injection and Markdown injection.
- Enhance monitoring and anomaly detection for prompt and output activities.
- Apply security best practices for prompt design to minimize out-of-scope task execution.
- Regularly update and patch the system to address emerging vulnerabilities.
- Conduct ongoing security assessments to ensure robustness against evolving attack techniques.
