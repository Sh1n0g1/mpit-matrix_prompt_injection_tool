## Executive Summary

The security assessment reveals a concerning trend of high failure rates across most attack vectors, notably **Remote Code Execution** and **Cross-Site Scripting**, which showed no successful exploits. Conversely, **Out-of-Scope Requests** demonstrated a relatively high success rate, indicating potential vulnerabilities in handling unexpected inputs. **SQL Injection** and **Markdown Injection** had limited success, suggesting partial mitigation. The low success rate in **Prompt Leaking** indicates some resilience against prompt injection attacks. Overall, the environment exhibits significant vulnerabilities, especially in critical attack types, underscoring the need for robust security controls. 

## Recommendations
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
- Enforce least privilege access controls.
- Regularly update and patch systems.
- Conduct ongoing security testing and monitoring.
