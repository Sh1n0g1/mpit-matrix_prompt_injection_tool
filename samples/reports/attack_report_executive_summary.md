## Executive Summary

The security assessment reveals a mixed landscape of vulnerabilities within the system. Notably, **FreeLLM (low severity)** and **Markdown Injection (medium severity)** attacks were entirely successful, indicating critical weaknesses that could allow attackers to utilize the language model for unintended tasks and leak data through rendered Markdown content. 

**Prompt Leaking (medium severity)** and **Cross-Site Scripting (high severity)** attacks demonstrated partial success rates of approximately 41.7% and 33.3%, respectively, highlighting inconsistent defenses against prompt injection and script execution threats. 

Conversely, **SQL Injection (high severity)** and **Remote Code Execution (critical severity)** attacks were entirely unsuccessful, suggesting effective mitigation measures are in place for these high-impact vulnerabilities.

## Recommendations

- Prioritize addressing the vulnerabilities associated with **FreeLLM** and **Markdown Injection** to prevent misuse and data leaks.
- Enhance defenses against **Prompt Leaking** and **Cross-Site Scripting** by implementing stricter input validation and output sanitization.
- Continue monitoring and testing for **SQL Injection** and **Remote Code Execution** to maintain their mitigation status.
- Regularly update security protocols and conduct penetration testing to identify and remediate emerging threats.
