## Executive Summary

The assessment reveals critical vulnerabilities in **Markdown Injection** and **Out-of-Scope Requests**, with success rates of over 90% and 100%, respectively, indicating significant security risks. **Cross-Site Scripting** shows a moderate success rate (~45%), posing potential session hijacking threats. Conversely, **Remote Code Execution** and **SQL Injection** attacks were entirely unsuccessful, suggesting effective mitigation measures. The **Prompt Leaking** attack demonstrated a notable success rate (~25%), highlighting potential exposure of internal prompts and logic. These findings underscore the need for robust input validation, strict role enforcement, and continuous security monitoring to mitigate high-impact vulnerabilities and prevent exploitation.

## Recommendations

- Implement comprehensive input sanitization and validation.
- Enforce strict role-based access controls.
- Regularly update and patch systems to address known vulnerabilities.
- Conduct ongoing security testing and prompt injection defenses.
