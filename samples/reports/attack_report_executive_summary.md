## Executive Summary

The security assessment reveals a varied landscape of vulnerabilities within the system. Notably, **Out-of-Score Request (OSR)** vulnerabilities are fully exploitable, with all attempts succeeding, indicating a significant risk of out-of-scope task execution. **Markdown Injection (MDI)** vulnerabilities are highly prevalent, with a success rate of over 90%, posing a substantial threat of data leakage through rendered content. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks show a moderate success rate of approximately 45%, highlighting potential for malicious script execution within the environment. Conversely, **SQL Injection (SQLi)** and **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerabilities were not successfully exploited during testing, suggesting these vectors are currently well mitigated. The high success rate of OSR and MDI attacks underscores the need for immediate security enhancements.

## Recommendations

- Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent OSR and MDI exploits.
- Enhance output encoding and content security policies to mitigate XSS risks.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address emerging vulnerabilities.
- Limit the permissions and capabilities of the LLM environment to reduce the impact of successful attacks.
- Monitor system logs for unusual activity indicative of attempted or successful exploits.
